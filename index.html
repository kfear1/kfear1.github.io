    <p>My name is Katie, and I am a Senior at UNC Chapel Hill, majoring in Environmental Studies and Global Studies, with a minor in Data Science.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I am currently looking to work in geospatial engineering, focusing on developing tools to support environmental management. My current interests include exploring the intersection between sustainable agriculture and GIS, as well as learning about land management, cover cropping, and other practices to maintain and improve soil health. Other interests include how identity and food are related, textile production, and water management. </p>

    <p>Description: </p>
    <p>In this project, I focused on using Python and R to conduct an analysis of the socioeconomic status of those most at risk from polluted flood waters. I used the library arcpy to execute this project, as well as R to clean my data. I took current flood prediction maps and added a buffer around them to account for increased flood severity resulting from climate change. I then added a point file with the locations of the concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) in North Carolina, and used the clip tool to select the CAFOs that were within the flood zones. Then, I joined socioeconomic data with a zipcode shape file and used the overlay tool to analyse the socioeconomic groups most at risk of pollution from CAFO flooding.  </p>

    <img src="kfear_assessment.jpg" style="height:600px;" alt="Riparian Vegetation Burn Area" />
    <p>Description:</p>
    <p>In this project, I used the buffer and intersect tools to highlight the vegetation within 200m of a creek that was impacted by burning </p>

    <h5>Date: November 6th 2024 </h5>
  
    <img src="lab6.jpg" style="height:600px;" alt="Benzene and Population" />
    <p>Description</p>
    <p> In this project, I created a map representing the Benzene levels in the air compared to the population of each county in North Carolina</p>

    <h5>Date: October 2nd 2024 </h5>
    <img src="lab_3.jpg" style="height:600px;" alt="Portland Schools" />
    
    <p>In this project,t I practiced using symbols and legends to represent schools within a region of Portland, Oregon</p>
