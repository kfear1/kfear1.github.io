    Hello! I'm Katie, welcome to my website, I built it myself! 
  </p>
  <p>
    This website is still a work in progress, I am constantly adding new projects and fine tuning small elements here and there
  </p>
  <p> Please take a look around at some of my projects!</p>

    <!-- <p>Hello! My name is Katie, and I am a Senior at UNC Chapel Hill, majoring in Environmental Studies and Global Studies, with a minor in Data Science.
    </p>
    <p> My interests range from agriculture and food ways, to water pollution and flooding, and my projects often explore the intersections between environmental justice, sustainability, and technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      My work at the moment focuses on cattle supply chains in the Amazon thrugh the lense of deforestation. I am currently interning with Aid Environment in the Netherlands to analyse
      which cattle producers are engaging in deforestation. Other recent work of mine includes
      performing flood plane analysis in North Carolina, and exploring the impacts of severe flooding on CAFO related pollution.
    </p>
    <p> When I am not studying or working, I enjoy reading, climbing, running, and cooking.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I am currently looking to work in geospatial engineering, focusing on developing tools to support environmental management. My current interests include exploring the intersection between sustainable agriculture and GIS, as well as learning about land management, cover cropping, and other practices to maintain and improve soil health. Other interests include how identity and food are related, textile production, and water management. </p>

     <p>I’m a senior at UNC Chapel Hill majoring in Environmental Studies and Global Studies, with a minor in Data Science.</p>

  <p>My academic and professional interests span agriculture, foodways, water pollution, and flooding. Much of my work explores the intersections of environmental justice, sustainability, and technology.</p>

  <p>Currently, I’m interning with AidEnvironment in the Netherlands, where I analyze cattle supply chains in the Amazon through the lens of deforestation, identifying producers linked to land clearance. My recent projects also include floodplain analysis in North Carolina and investigating how severe flooding contributes to pollution from Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs).</p>

  <!-- <p>Outside of work and study, I enjoy reading, climbing, running, and cooking.</p> -->

  <p>I’m currently seeking opportunities in geospatial analysis, with a focus on building tools to support environmental justice projects. I’m also interested in the intersection of sustainable agriculture and GIS, and I’m eager to learn more about land management, cover cropping, and strategies to enhance soil health. I’m curious about the relationships between identity and food, textile production, and water systems.</p>

  <!-- To do: 

  Add contact methods
  Add Git hub
  Add resume
  Should I just put my About me on this page
  Explain that I designed this Website?
  Need to add skills and projects
  Could make a nav bar page and link to it to avoid having all the same code
  Tidy up- add divs etc. -->
