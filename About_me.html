    <p>My name is Katie, and I am a Senior at UNC Chapel Hill, majoring in Environmental Studies and Global Studies, with a minor in Data Science.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I am currently looking to work in geospatial engineering, focusing on developing tools to support environmental management. My current interests include exploring the intersection between sustainable agriculture and GIS, as well as learning about land management, cover cropping, and other practices to maintain and improve soil health. Other interests include how identity and food are related, textile production, and water management. </p>
