    <p>Description: </p>
    <p>In this project, I focused on using Python and R to conduct an analysis of the socioeconomic status of those most at risk from polluted flood waters. I used the library arcpy to execute this project, as well as R to clean my data. I took current flood prediction maps and added a buffer around them to account for increased flood severity resulting from climate change. I then added a point file with the locations of the concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) in North Carolina, and used the clip tool to select the CAFOs that were within the flood zones. Then, I joined socioeconomic data with a zipcode shape file and used the overlay tool to analyse the socioeconomic groups most at risk of pollution from CAFO flooding.  </p>
