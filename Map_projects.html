    <img src="datacenter_map.png" class="responsive-image" alt="Data center distribution throughout the South" />
    <p>Description: </p>
    <p>This map shows the distribution of data centers throughout the American South (specifically the 6 states in which SELC operates). The purpose of this map is to visualize where data centers are being constructed, with the end goal of understanding how local energy grids will be impacted as this sector continues to grow.</p>

    <p>Description: </p>
    <p>This map shows the distribution of warehouses in Savannah, GA, and their date of construction. The purpose of this map is to show how the port expansion impacted construction in the surrounding area. </p>

    <p>Description: </p>
    <p>This was the map output of my summer internship with AidEnvironment. I used both R and Python workflows to improve and automate the cleaning and processing of 
      cadastre data and animal transport records in Brazil, in order to find indirect suppliers in the beef supply chain. </p>

    <p>Description: </p>
    <p>In this project, I focused on using Python and R to conduct an analysis of the socioeconomic status of those most at risk from polluted flood waters. I used the library arcpy to execute this project, as well as R to clean my data. I took current flood prediction maps and added a buffer around them to account for increased flood severity resulting from climate change. I then added a point file with the locations of the concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) in North Carolina, and used the clip tool to select the CAFOs that were within the flood zones. Then, I joined socioeconomic data with a zipcode shape file and used the overlay tool to analyse the socioeconomic groups most at risk of pollution from CAFO flooding.  </p>

    <img src="Augusta_income.png" class="responsive-image" alt="Weighted average income in Augusta" />
    <p>Description: </p>
    <p>In this project, I used R to create a map of the variation in average income in Georgia, using ring buffers representing the distance from Augusta. The average income in each ring is weighted by the area of the income polygons it contains, ensuring larger regions have a proportionate influence.  . The code for this map can be found on my GitHub, as well as linked on the code page of this website. </p>

    <p>Description:</p>
    <p>In this project, I used the buffer and intersect tools to highlight the vegetation within 200m of a creek that was impacted by burning </p>

    <p>Description</p>
    <p> In this project, I created a map representing the Benzene levels in the air compared to the population of each county in North Carolina</p>
